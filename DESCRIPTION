Description: The Concomitant evaluation of Distinctness and Similarity (CDS) is a fold-change-based statistical test that allows to detect differentially and similarly expressed genes. Given two sets of gene measurements in different biological conditions, probabilities of making type I and type II errors in stating that a gene is differentially or similarly expressed from one condition to the other can be calculated. Furthermore, a confidence interval for the fold-change can be delineated.
